# 📊 E-Commerce Sales & Profit Analysis Project

## 📁 Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an e-commerce dataset to extract key insights related to sales, profit, product performance, and customer segments. The analysis is conducted in two stages:

- 📌 **Python (Jupyter Notebook)**: For data preprocessing, exploration, and basic visualizations.
- 📌 **Power BI**: For creating interactive and dynamic dashboards for decision-making.
